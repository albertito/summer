  Utility to detect accidental data corruption (e.g. bitrot, storage media
  problems).  Not intended to detect malicious modification.
  
  Checksums are written to/read from each files' extended attributes by default,
  or to a separate database file (with the -db flag).
  
  Usage:
  
    summer update <dir>
        Verify checksums in the given directory, and update them for new or
        changed files.
    summer verify <dir>
        Verify checksums in the given directory.
    summer generate <dir>
        Write checksums for the given directory. Files with pre-existing
        checksums are left untouched, and checksums are not verified.
        Useful when generating checksums for a lot of files for the first time,
        as is faster to resume work if interrupted.
    summer version
        Print software version information.
