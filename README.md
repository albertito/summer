# summer 🌞 🏖

Utility to detect accidental data corruption (e.g. bitrot, storage media
problems).  Not intended to detect malicious modification.

Checksums are written to/read from each file's extended attributes.


## Status

summer is still under active development. The user interface and on-disk
format may change in backwards-incompatible ways.


## Install

```
go install blitiri.com.ar/go/summer@latest
```


## Example

The most common use case is to run `summer update`, which writes checksums for
new or modified files, and verifies the checksums of the files which have not
been modified.

The `-x` flag stops summer from crossing filesystem boundaries (for each of
the given paths).

```
sudo summer -x update /home /etc /usr
```
